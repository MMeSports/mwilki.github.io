Instructions for how to run your program 
This project was designed as a web application and can be opened in any of your favorite web browsers.

An overview of design decisions 
I chose to utilize a free bootstrap template that allowed for responsive flow between media views.

What language you picked and why 
vanilla JavaScript and jQuery for ajax / dom manipulation.
I chose JS because it was immediately relevant to Kipsu's tech stack.

Your process for verifying the correctness of you program 
I actively tried to break the application.
Validation measurements were also made to guarantee a client wouldn't send a blank message to their guest.

What didn't you get to, or what else might you do with more time?
I'd like to hook the application up to a MySQL database.
Something else that would be cool - append some links relevant to the guest's city (restaurants, beaches, stores) that are withing a < 5 mile radius of their hotel.
